About me: I am a hobbyist programmer mainly focused on Python 3. I have also minor experience with html and css as well as some college courses using C.

Professionally I am a licensed electrical engineer in power. I work with the high voltage electric grid.

I am interested in a variety of things with programming and have yet to focus on one area. I have interest in web development, machine learning, neural networks, web scraping, and other various topics.
